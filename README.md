:pushpin: Back-end requirements : C#, MongoDB ; Front-end requirements : Angular

:pushpin: The aim of this project is to enhance my fullstack skills and understand how apps are made.

:pushpin: The page design part (HTML/CSS) was not really where my main focus, this is why pages are not necessarily aesthetic.
